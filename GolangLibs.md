Golang Tools and Libraries
======================
> My personal list and evaluation notes of Golang libraries and tools.
###Web Development 
1. Gorilla Web Toolkit
2. Ravel
3. Beegee

### Databases

#### 1. Cayley
[Cayley](https://github.com/google/cayley) is an open-source graph inspired by the graph database behind Freebase and Google's Knowledge Graph. Its goal is to be a part of the developer's toolbox where Linked Data and graph-shaped data (semantic webs, social networks, etc) in general are concerned.
