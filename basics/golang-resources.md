GoLang Development
===================

####Go Arrays and Slices

An array literal can be specified like so:
```go
 b := [2]string{"Penn", "Teller"}

//Or, you can have the compiler count the array elements for you:

b := [..]string{"Penn", "Teller"}

```

 - Arrays do not need to be initialized explicitly; the zero value of an array is a ready-to-use array whose elements are themselves zeroed:
 - The in-memory representation of [4]int is just four integer values laid out sequentially:
 - Go's arrays are values. An array variable denotes the entire array; it is not a pointer to the first array element (as would be the case in C). This means that when you **assign or pass around an array value you will make a copy of its contents**. (To avoid the copy you could pass a pointer to the array, but then that's a pointer to an array, not an array.)
 -  One way to think about arrays is as a sort of struct but with indexed rather than named fields: a fixed-size composite value.

#### Go Install Notes

 - Use [gvm,](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) go version manager to install and use multiple versions of go at the same time.
 - gvm does not install godoc therefore install godoc tool by typing in the following
 ```shell
    $ go get -u code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc
    #Run the following command to run the go docs locally
    $ godoc -http=:6060  ## point a browser to localhost:6060 to see documentationvb b
    
 ```
